# ASP.NET MVC with Vue.js

A sample project demonstrating the use of Vue.js with .NET MVC - (based loosely on http://www.lambdatwist.com/dot-net-vuejs/)

Components included:
* Node.js - for managing javascript packages
* Browserify - for bundling, minifying etc...
* Gulp - for auto task deployment
* Gentelella bootstrap template - just to check out if it's doable
* jQuery - to show Vue.js can work alongside jQuery
* vue-router - Single Page Application demo

Sample pages:
* Basic Vue.js binding
* Vue.js single page application - routing with components demo
* Fetching data from serwer (normal controller rather than web api 2.0 but no reason why it would not work)
